"""Generate Appendix B, the derivation index, from the chapter sources (OUTLINE.md Appendix B, STYLE.md 2 and 7).

The index is read from the book itself, so it cannot drift from the chapters. Every scheme file
(`book/chapters/NN-slug/_<scheme>.qmd`, or a chapter file with its own `## ... {#sec-...}` schemes) is
scanned for its Derivation layer (STYLE 2). Each labelled equation `{#eq-...}` in that layer is one row:

  * the scheme (`@sec-...`) and the equation (`@eq-...`), as cross-references;
  * the derivation: the sentence that leads into the equation, or the statement given for it in
    `tools/derivation-statements/chNN.json` (equation label -> one line), which wins when present;
  * the code: the code site the chapter tags the equation with (STYLE 2: "each numbered equation that the
    code implements is tagged with the code site that implements it"): the first code link after the
    equation in the layer, else the first one before it, given as its anchor symbol (the one the citation
    checker reads) and its `file:lines` text. The link itself stays in the chapter, which owns the citation;
    the index repeats no URL, so a citation is checked once, where it is made;
  * the check: the executable check scripts the scheme file names (`<scheme>_check.py`, STYLE 7) that exist
    under `src/pyharp_report/chNN/checks/`, and the check lines (`[Cn]`) the layer quotes next to the equation;
    a comment `<!-- equation-check: eq-... script.py [tag] -->` names one check line of a script under
    `chNN/checks/` or `derivation-checks/` for that equation (tag `[x]` or `(x)`, or none for the whole script);
  * the source: "exists" when the layer cites a derivation note (`docs/derivations/` or `sources/`), else
    "re-derived"; a comment `<!-- equation-source: eq-... note -->` appends a note, e.g. "code differs (D65)".

A scheme whose Derivation layer labels no equation gets one row with its first sentence (often "None: ..."),
so every written scheme appears once at least, as OUTLINE asks (one row per scheme). Appendix files and the
generated fragment itself are not scanned.

The output is one file per chapter, `appendices/_appb-chNN.qmd` with that chapter's rows, and the parent
`_appb-derivation-index.qmd`, which holds the introduction, the summary table and the includes of the chapter
files. No committed file holds a count over several chapters: the totals and the summary counts are
`{{< generated appb ... >}}` shortcodes, filled in at render from `book/_generated/appb.json` (not committed),
which this script writes too. So a pull request that edits one chapter changes only that chapter's file, and two
that edit different chapters merge cleanly (tools/generated_values.py; README, "Generated files and rebasing").
The given statements are one file per chapter for the same reason: `tools/derivation-statements/chNN.json`
holds the labels `eq-chNN-...` and no other, and a label in the wrong chapter's file, a label given twice in a
file, or a statement that is not a string is an input error (`load_statements`).

book/_quarto.yml runs this script as its pre-render step, so every render (local or CI) writes the files from
the chapters as they are. The files are also committed, because Quarto fails on an include whose file does not
exist before the pre-render step runs; tools/tests fails when a committed copy differs from a fresh generation.
The script needs only the Python standard library, and finishes in well under a second.

    python3 tools/gen_derivation_index.py           # rewrite the files and values (the pre-render step)
    python3 tools/gen_derivation_index.py --check   # exit 1 if a committed file is not what the sources give
    python3 tools/gen_derivation_index.py --stats   # counts per chapter, to stdout
    python3 tools/gen_derivation_index.py --book <dir> --fragment <file>   # another tree (e.g. a draft branch)

Exit status 0 on success, 1 if `--check` finds a difference, 2 for an input error.
