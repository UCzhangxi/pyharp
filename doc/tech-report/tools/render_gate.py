"""G1 render gate that can actually see LuaLaTeX's complaints.

THE PROBLEM THIS EXISTS FOR (ISSUES #9)
---------------------------------------
BOOKCRAFT section 6 defines G1 as a grep over `quarto render`'s **stdout** for
`warn|error|unable|missing character|undefined`. LuaLaTeX does not write most of
those to stdout. It writes them to `book/index.log`, **and quarto deletes that
log on a successful render** -- so for nine waves the gate greped for strings
that could never appear, and passed.

What it could not see, measured on the wave-11 build:

  * **42 `Missing character` warnings.** A missing character is not cosmetic:
    LuaLaTeX DROPS the glyph from the PDF. A tilde or a mu vanishes from a
    printed sentence while the HTML is fine and nothing is reported.
  * **2 multiply-defined labels** (`tbl-whipple-e`, `tbl-pcr-e1`), which make a
    cross-reference resolve to the wrong target.
  * 2034 overfull and 85 underfull boxes, which are typography rather than
    defects, and are reported here only as a count.

THE THIRD BLIND SPOT (ISSUES #10), FOLDED IN 2026-09-02
-------------------------------------------------------
Maths written into a GENERATED TABLE CELL reaches the reader as literal LaTeX,
and a cross-reference in a cell does not resolve -- in the HTML and the PDF
alike. That is invisible to every gate above: the source is well formed, so
`check_math_spans.py` passes; the stdout gate sees nothing; and the log only
notices when a macro happens to be a character-mapping one, which caught 4 of
390. The instrument is a scan of the RENDERED `<th>`/`<td>` contents, which
lives in `tools/check_table_cells.py` and is run from here so that G1 covers
it. **It is folded in rather than left standalone because ISSUES #9's whole
lesson is that a gate nobody runs is a gate that does not exist.**

ADAPTED FOR THE pyharp TECHNICAL REPORT (STYLE.md 10.9)
--------------------------------------------------------
Imported from the house books unchanged (commit "move the house render-gate
scripts") and changed only where this report differs:

  * Sources: a chapter is `book/chapters/NN-slug.qmd` plus its scheme files
    `book/chapters/NN-slug/_<scheme>.qmd` (STYLE 10.1), so every source gate
    reads `chapters/**/*.qmd` and names files by their path under `book/`.
  * The LaTeX log is `book/index.log`, or the newest `book/*.log` if the book
    sets another output name; `--log` overrides.
  * Overfull boxes wider than 10 pt FAIL (STYLE 10.9); smaller ones and the
    underfull ones are still only counted. `--overfull-pt` sets the limit.
  * After the render the HTML and the PDF must both be in `book/_book/`
    (STYLE 10.9 renders both from one command; quarto deletes the HTML of a
    book when `--to pdf` is rendered on its own).
  * The freeze gate asks for a tracked `_freeze/` cache only for chapters
    that have a python cell; a chapter without one has nothing to freeze.
  * The table-cell fix message names this report's route (a markdown table).
  * Three outcomes, PASS, PENDING and FAIL (lead's ruling): a `pyharp_report`
    function that a chapter imports but that is not written yet is PENDING,
    not a failure, and so is a book with no `_quarto.yml` yet. The render runs
    with a placeholder figure for each pending function, so every other gate
    still sees the whole book. Nothing is released while anything is pending.

USAGE
-----
    python tools/render_gate.py book/            # render, then gate
    python tools/render_gate.py book/ --no-render   # gate an existing log
    python tools/render_gate.py book/ --labels-only # source gates only, no build
    python tools/render_gate.py book/ --release     # PENDING counts as a failure

Exit status: 0 PASS, 1 FAIL, 2 PENDING (nothing failed, something is pending).

⚠️ **Do not run this while another session is rendering the same book.**
`_book/` and `_freeze/` are shared state, which is why chapter writers are
forbidden to run quarto at all. To gate a book another session owns, copy the
book directory elsewhere and run there -- the `_freeze` cache is committed, so
the cells do not re-run and the copy costs a couple of minutes.

⚠️ `-M latex-clean:false` is what keeps `index.log` alive. It is passed on the
command line rather than written into `_quarto.yml` so that this gate needs no
change to a file other sessions own.

    Two of ch51's three were caught, and only because ``@tbl-...`` appeared elsewhere in the

    🔴 **No other gate in this file can see it, and the reason generalises.** Every other gate

    Added at the W34 close (2026-09-14, `ISSUES` #54), found by ch57 failing its first full
    render after every source gate above had passed.

    **The mechanism, reproduced in isolation before the rule was written.**  Inside a list
    item -- and ``(a)``, ``(b)`` are list items, pandoc renders them with
    ``\def\labelenumi{(\alph{enumi})}`` -- a continuation line beginning ``- `` or ``+ ``
    starts a REAL sibling bullet list.  That ends the paragraph, and with it the open inline
    maths span.  The opening ``$`` never closes, pandoc escapes the lot as text
    (``n\_\{\mathrm{H^0}\}Q\_\{31\}\$``) **but passes ``\mathrm`` through as a control
    sequence**, and LuaLaTeX dies with *"\mathrm allowed only in math mode"*.

    ⛔ **THE LIST-ITEM CONDITION IS THE WHOLE RULE, AND A PATTERN MATCH WITHOUT IT IS WRONG.**
    In ordinary prose a leading ``-``/``+`` is a lazy continuation and pandoc keeps the maths
    span intact.  A first scan for "maths span containing a line that starts with a bullet"
    returned **three** hits across the book -- ch02:39 and ch54:589 as well as ch57 -- and
    **both of the others are in plain prose and have been rendering correctly for dozens of
    waves.**  They were checked against `pandoc -t latex` and left alone.  ★ Had the rule been
    written from the pattern rather than from the mechanism, this gate's first act would have
    been to send someone to "fix" two shipped chapters that are not broken.

    which is the one thing `BOOKCRAFT` §5's freeze exists to prevent.

    🔴 **The reason this needs a gate is the check that MISSES it, and it is the sharpest
    instance of W30's carry-forward the book has produced.** At the moment the defect was
    live, tracked freeze directories numbered **54** and chapters in `_quarto.yml` numbered

# PENDING (exit 2: nothing failed, but at least one called function or the book itself does not
# exist yet) and FAIL (exit 1). `--release` turns PENDING into a failure.
#
# The render must still run while a function is pending, or every other gate is blind. The cells
# that import a pending function get a placeholder: before the render, an IPython startup file
# (in a temporary IPYTHONDIR, so nothing outside the render is touched) puts a stand-in module or
# attribute into the kernel. Each stand-in returns a small figure that says PENDING, so the
# figure's label and caption still exist and its cross-references still resolve. Anything else
# a pyharp_report module raises on import (a syntax error, a bad import inside it) is a FAIL.
#
# A placeholder that reaches `_freeze/` stays there after the function is written, because
# `freeze: auto` re-runs a chapter only when its .qmd changes. The placeholder figure's text
# repr carries PENDING_MARK, and the freeze gate fails on a frozen placeholder for a function
